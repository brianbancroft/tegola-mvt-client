Tegola-Mapbox Client Example
---

This is a usage example of using Tegola as a MVT Server with MapboxGL.

This works best if you have a web server running locally. If you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine, you can have a web server fast and furious. In the console:

- `npm install`
- `npm run start`

Boom! A web server!
